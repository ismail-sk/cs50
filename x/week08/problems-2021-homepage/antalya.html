                        Words are often insufficient to describe the natural beauties of Antalya, where countless civilizations have emerged on the stage of history since the early days of human history, with its location and fertile lands.

                        <h4>Kaleici</h4>
                        <p>
                            The origins of the region date back to the Hellenistic period and it also includes structures from Seljuk and Ottoman times. While spending time here, you can also visit cultural venues and evaluate entertainment opportunities. <br>
                            While walking the narrow streets of Kaleiçi, you can have the opportunity to see the most beautiful examples of Ottoman civil architecture in this geography. Some of the buildings have been converted into boutique hotels. In some, cultural venues such as the Suna-İnan Kıraç Museum , cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops operate. <br>
                            Apart from visiting museums and art galleries, you can also show interest in historical places. Hadrian's Gate and the Yivli Minaret, which I will tell you about in the following parts of the list, are among the places that shed light on the rich history of the region. <br>
                            When it comes to entertainment, you can turn to two different options, respectively. First of all, you can get the opportunity to observe Antalya from different angles by getting on the excursion boats departing from the port, which will impress you with its view. <br>

                        <h4>Hadrian's Gate</h4>
                        <p>
                            Hadrian's Gate, one of the most important symbols of Antalya , was built in 130 to celebrate the arrival of Emperor Hadrianus in the city and to impress him. <br>
                            The gate, which is one of the most popular historical structures in Kaleiçi, allowed entrance to the city from the port side for a long time. <br>
                            The historical artifact, which the local people mostly call " Three Doors ", has survived to the present day without much deterioration, as it remained within the walls over time. In fact, some additions were made to the upper part of the north tower during the Seljuk period. <br>
                            The building reveals all the splendor of Roman architecture. The gate, which has three transition points supported by round arches, is supported by Corinthian marble columns. In order to make its appearance much more impressive, it is decorated with carvings and reliefs. <br>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Yivli Minaret</h4>
                        <p>
                            After the gate, you can turn your route to the Yivli Minaret , which is the first Islamic period monument in the city . Adding splendor to the Kaleiçi district for centuries, the minaret was built by the Seljuks in the 13th century. <br>
                            The minaret, whose pedestal was made of cut stone and whose body was built with bricks, has a height of 45 meters. The name of the mighty structure, the visuality of the body part of which is enhanced by turquoise colored tiles, comes from the eight grooves included in its design in accordance with the architectural understanding of that period. <br>
                            The minaret, like itself, is located in the complex, along with a number of structures from the Seljuk period. Among these structures, the Yivli Mosque attracts the most attention. <br>
                            The structure is considered to be one of the oldest of the multi-domed mosques built in Anatolia. Another remarkable part of the complex is Zincirkıran Mehmed Bey Tomb, which is now used as a fine arts gallery. <br>

                        <h4>Konyaalti Beach</h4>
                        <p>
                            There are two stories that are frequently told about where the name of the beach, which covers the 7-kilometer coastline between the cliffs and Antalya Port, comes from. <br>
                            In the first of these, it is said that the name of the beach is derived from the word " under the bay " because it is located just below the cliffs . In another, it is mentioned that the area where the soldiers gathered during the Ottoman period was called Konyaüstü. Legend has it that the local people started to refer to the coastal part below this area as Konyaaltı over time. <br>
                            Regardless of where the name comes from, the beach certainly gives its guests the opportunity to cool off on the hot summer days of Antalya. For this, if you wish, you can choose the 4.5 kilometer free section. There are also paid sections on the beach for those looking for alternatives and a variety of services. <br>

                            Of course, when it comes to rafting, one should definitely not miss the Köprülü Canyon, which is considered one of the most famous tracks in the world . Protected as a national park, the canyon covers an area of 25 kilometers from Kasımlar in Isparta to Değirmenözü Village in Antalya. <br>
                            In the heart of Köprüçay , around the canyon where it flows, there are restaurants where you can taste fresh trout. The region also hosts accommodation options for nature lovers. <br>
                            In the region, you can focus on ziplining and rock climbing experience, apart from rafting. If you wish, you can take great opportunities to go for long walks and explore the environment on the safe tracks created on the canyon walls. Visitors are also offered options such as ATV, unimog and horse safari or cycling tours. <br>

                            Saklıkent Ski Center , built on the Beydağları, is waiting to be visited, only 1 hour away from the city center, which is scorched due to the high temperatures in summer. The ski season in the center starts in the second week of December and continues until the middle of April. <br>
                            The winter sports center, which continues its activities with the slogan of “ skiing during the day, sea in the afternoon ”, has four tracks with different difficulty levels. In addition to these tracks, which are accessible from three chairlift lines, a special track has been created for guests who want to sleigh. <br>

                            If you spare time for Liman Street during your visit to the ancient settlement, you can closely examine the remains of structures such as the agora and the theatre. When you reach Hadrian's Gate at the end of the street, you can encounter a wonderful view. <br>

                            You can reserve the last row of your list of places to visit in Antalya, Side Antique City . B.C. The ancient settlement, which was founded in the 7th century and came under the rule of the Lydian Kingdom shortly after its appearance on the stage of history, has turned into an important commercial center with the advantage of being a port city. <br>
                            The city, which responded to the arrival of Alexander and his armies with unconditional surrender, started to be counted among the major coinage centers in this period. The ancient settlement, which changed hands frequently after Alexander, finally came under the rule of the Romans. <br>
                            The theater, which was built during the Roman period, is now considered the most important work that can be seen in the ancient city. Apart from the building bearing the traces of the Hellenistic architectural style, the ruins of the temples dedicated to Apollo and Athena also attract great attention. <br>
