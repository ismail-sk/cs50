                            Due to the heat of the city, the houses built of cut stone are also famous for keeping them cool in the summer. Most of the houses, which are generally two-storey and located in the courtyard, serve as hotels today. <br>

                            The covered bazaar, which was used by butchers for a long time, was restored in 2008 and gained a new silhouette. <br>
                            Today, nearly 80 shops selling spices, handicrafts, local and touristic products serve their customers in the covered bazaar. <br>

                            It is known that the castle, which was used for surveillance during the Roman period, has been restored many times throughout history. <br>

                            So what to eat in Gaziantep? Gaziantep, the gastronomic city of the world, has more than 300 dishes from Hittite, Byzantine, Egyptian and Ottoman. We can say that especially Antep baklava has a worldwide reputation.
                            It is possible to find a flavor suitable for every palate in Gaziantep, which has the widest cuisine in Turkey with its soups, stuffed meats, pastries, meat dishes, kebabs and desserts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The dishes, flavored with local spices, offer a feast of taste. Although we can't finish counting the unique dishes of the city, the new world kebab, currant kebab, simit kebab, quince kebab, squash soup, siveydiz soup, beyran, plum pan, embroidered stuffing, curd semsek, zucchini, and maş stand out more than other flavors. Here are the addresses of the unique flavors that beat in the heart of Antep, whose heart is wounded but knows the taste of its mouth:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Imam Çağdaş – Baklava: They beat those who came to Antep without eating baklava! There is no panic, these are jokes, but you still have a taste of Imam Çağdaş's baklava. You should definitely try the legendary carrot slice at Imam Çağdaş, which is located around the Old Hall in Şahinbey. You enter your dreams at night, you yearn for it, and it carries you to Antep many times.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Hüseyin Usta – Downsizing: Hüseyin Usta, who has been in service since 1972, is a marvel at downsizing. The reputation of the küşleme here, which is served as plain and spicy, has almost stuck to the name of the city. This place, which was the handiwork of Halil Usta, who used to be a butcher, still preserves its modesty on the first day. Moreover, without losing anything from the taste of the products it offers…
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Zekeriya Usta – Katmer: Located in Çukur Mahallesi, Zekeriya Usta is one of the places that best represents one of Gaziantep's most famous flavors, katmer. Katmer, which is quite sweet, has a crispy texture. You should go and try this flavor that comes out with the harmony of cream, pistachio and sugar.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Tahmis Coffee – Zahter Tea/Melengiç Coffee: It is a must to drink zahter tea at Tahmis Kahvesi, which has been hosting its guests in Almacı Bazaar since 1635! This tea, which calms the nerves and facilitates digestion, can also be consumed with sugar, honey or lemon, if desired. You should also try the melengic coffee and Tahmis cookie, which delights the eye with its presentation, in this place where people of all ages and walks of life frequent.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bayazhan Restaurant – Simit Kebab: Bayazhan Restaurant, which is one of the establishments that makes the best simit kebab, one of the flavors unique to Gaziantep, is one of the addresses you can stop by to satisfy your hunger at this point of your trip, as it serves just below the Gaziantep City Museum. You will also love the appetizers of this place, which also organizes chapters.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Orkide Patisserie – Breakfast: It is unlikely that you will find a breakfast like the one you will have at Orkide Patisserie anywhere else. In the venue, which will host you with a very appetizing table, you can meet with homemade jams, various kinds of cream, katmer, cheese varieties and many more local delicacies.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Portable Licorice Sherbet: Do not miss the opportunity of licorice sherbet that will come to your feet. Because you will be sad! These people, selling sherbet by walking around the streets in local clothes, are actually striving for the continuation of a culture. You can taste it once, both to gain a new experience and to make the hops smile.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Çulcuoğlu Steak House – Lahmacun: If you want to eat a crispy lahmacun, you should change your route in Gaziantep to Çulcuoğlu Et Lokantası in Şahinbey. The star of the place, which hosts delicacies such as simit kebab, Ali Nazik, Beyti and onion kebab, is definitely lahmacun.
                                </li>
